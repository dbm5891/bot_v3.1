## Implementation Plan

The improvements will be implemented by modifying the relevant React components within the `frontend/src/` directory. Each task will involve:
1. Identifying the target component(s).
2. Reading and understanding the existing code.
3. Applying the necessary changes to JSX, styles, and logic.
4. Testing the changes visually.
