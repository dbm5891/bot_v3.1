# Playwright E2E Test Setup Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Installed Playwright** - Added `@playwright/test` and `playwright` as dev dependencies
2. **Created Playwright Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`)
   - Configured to run tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (WebKit)
   - Set up automatic server startup for both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8000)
   - Enabled parallel test execution
   - Configured test reporting and screenshots on failure

3. **Created E2E Test Suites**:
   - `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` - Tests for the dashboard page
   - `e2e/strategies.spec.ts` - Tests for the strategies page
   - `e2e/backtesting.spec.ts` - Tests for the backtesting functionality

4. **Added NPM Scripts**:
   - `npm run playwright:test` - Run all tests
   - `npm run playwright:test:headed` - Run tests with visible browser
   - `npm run playwright:test:ui` - Run tests in interactive UI mode
   - `npm run playwright:report` - View test report
   - `npm run playwright:codegen` - Generate tests using recorder

## Current Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 60 (20 tests Ã— 3 browsers)
- **Passed**: 17
- **Failed**: 43

## Why Tests Are Failing

The tests are failing because:
1. The mocked API responses in the tests don't match what the actual UI expects
2. Some UI elements have different selectors than what the tests are looking for
3. The actual application might have different routing or navigation behavior

## Next Steps to Fix Tests

1. **Update Test Selectors**: 
   - Run tests in headed mode to see actual UI
   - Update selectors to match actual elements
   - Use data-testid attributes for more reliable selection

2. **Align API Mocks**:
   - Check actual API responses from the backend
   - Update mock data to match real API structure

3. **Debug Individual Tests**:
   - Use `npm run playwright:test:ui` to debug interactively
   - Add `await page.pause()` to stop at specific points
   - Use `npm run playwright:codegen` to record correct interactions

## Benefits of Playwright

1. **Cross-browser Testing**: Tests run on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. **Fast Execution**: Tests run in parallel
3. **Better Debugging**: UI mode, trace viewer, and screenshots
4. **Modern API**: Async/await syntax, auto-waiting
5. **Mobile Testing**: Built-in device emulation

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run playwright:test

# Run in UI mode for debugging
npm run playwright:test:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/dashboard.spec.ts

# Generate new tests
npm run playwright:codegen
```
