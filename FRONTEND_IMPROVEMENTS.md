# Frontend Improvements Implementation

This document tracks the tasks related to improving the frontend, focusing on icon handling, component stability, and overall user experience.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] (Initial setup of this task list)
- [x] Review `StatCard.tsx` and `AppIcon.tsx` for icon handling issues.
- [x] Fix icon rendering, type errors, and linter errors in `StatCard.tsx`.
- [x] Verify `StatCard.tsx` integration within `DashboardPage.tsx`.
- [x] Address `StatCard` related console errors (via `PerformanceSummary.tsx`).
- [x] Address MUI Tooltip console errors on disabled buttons (in `TradingCalendar.tsx`, `DashboardHeader.tsx`).
- [x] Conduct initial review of icon usage (`AppIcon` vs MUI, direct Lucide imports).

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Resolve linter errors in `MarketStatusCard.tsx` (deferred due to complexity, but noted).
- [ ] Conduct further review of icon usage for consistency if new patterns emerge.

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Address any new console errors that may appear.

## Implementation Plan

The plan involves iteratively addressing component-level issues, starting with `StatCard` and `AppIcon`, and then broadening the scope to ensure consistency and correctness in icon usage and component interactions throughout the frontend.
